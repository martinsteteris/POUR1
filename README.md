# POUR1

My take on spoj.com problem [POUR1](https://www.spoj.com/problems/POUR1/). 

### Solution

I used recursion to get Greatest Common Divider of two values. 
GCD however is needed to determine if result is achievable.

### Run instructions and test generator

Just run solution.php in terminal to execute program. 

I created a simple test generator (testGenerator.php)
where you can configure amount of tests and random numbers ranges.
They are then written in test.txt if you execute testGenerator.php.

Or you can write custom tests right in test file and then execute solution.php
